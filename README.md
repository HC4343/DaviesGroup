# daviesGroup Project


I have created a BDD/Cucumber Framework. Test Cases are created regarding the Task.

I have created project by using Maven as a management tool.

I have written my test cases in feature files by using Gherkin Language which is plain English.

Corressponding feature files I have created Step Definition Files which are written by Java Languages and consist of seperated methods for each test step

I have Created my pages by Page Object Model. Each java class is against a page in project. These pages are have a 'Is A' relation between Base Page.
Base Page is created as Abstract class and Parent of all other page classes.

I also created a Runner class to run all test cases from one plase and also help connecting my packes each other.

And I created utilities package which stores my Driver, Configuration Reader and Browser Utils Classes.
