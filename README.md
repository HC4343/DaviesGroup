# daviesGroup Project


I have created a BDD/Cucumber Framework. Test Cases are created regarding the Task.

I have created project by using Maven as a management tool.

I have written my test cases in feature files by using Gherkin Language which is plain English.

Corressponding feature files I have created Step Definition Files which are written by Java Languages and consist of seperated methods for each test step

I have Created my pages by Page Object Model. Each java class is against a page in project. These pages are have a 'Is A' relation between Base Page.
Base Page is created as Abstract class and Parent of all other page classes.

I also created a Runner class to run all test cases from one plase and also help connecting my packes each other.

And I created utilities package which stores my Driver, Configuration Reader and Browser Utils Classes.

At the right top of the project you will see Code button, when you clich it you will see clone button with a url

First need to copy that url. When you open any IDE, you will see an option to create a new project.
